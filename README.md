[**The Power of Stellar**](https://beta.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar) - Here we explain a few powerful unique-to-Stellar financial featuresâ€”asset issuance, the networkâ€™s distributed order books, and the path-payments systemâ€”that are great for any fintech project.

[**Stellar Lumens**](https://beta.stellar.org/lumens) - You'll no doubt discover lumens while building on Stellar and you might even win some at the end of the weekend. This should help you wrap your head around what they are.

[**Stellar Overview Course**](https://www.lumenauts.com/courses/stellar-overview-course) - Lumenauts.com has put together a 30 minute video course covering the *basics* of many Stellar related topics. The course includes info about the network, the ledger, assets, anchors, the decentralized exchange, and more.

## Developer Resources
